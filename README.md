# go_board_game
In this board game I'll be creating the Go board game using my current HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills and as I learn more Front-end Web Development skills/frameworks/paradigms I'll use them in this project to take it from a simple one to a complex one. For instance, I'll need to use PHP and MySQL at some point to make this project more user friendly. In addition I may also add some C# but we'll see if this is necessary or not.
